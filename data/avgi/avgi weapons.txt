	description "This compact railgun rapidly fires a stream of hypervelocity projectiles, trading accuracy for sheer rate of fire. Friction between the projectiles and the rails is reduced via advanced techniques, but still produces enough heat that the gun must cool down after a burst of fire to prevent rail ablation."
	description "A small internal capacitor allows the Speckle Railgun to be trickle charged, even if a ship's power supply would otherwise be insufficient to fire a single shot."

	description "The turreted version of the Speckle Railgun mounts a pair of railguns onto a nimble swiveling base. Its light weight and minimal size allows even small ships to engage much larger targets at extreme ranges. By alternating the fire of each railgun on the turret, the required cooldown period can be staggered to let the turret maintain a constant rate of fire."

	description "Without the advanced insights needed to produce classical 'beam weapons' such as those used by humans and other species, the laser suffers from diffraction as it travels. This causes its damage to rapidly drop off with distance, becoming almost useless at its maximum range."

This makes it difficult to shoot down without very long ranged antimissile systems."

	description "The Equinox makes no compromises with its design goal of fitting the largest thermonuclear warhead feasible. After minimalizing its propulsion system to little more than a few reaction control thrusters, the Equinox is essentially an unguided torpedo. A carrying ship must instead both accelerate and aim the torpedo properly to ensure a hit."
	description "A thin coating of ablative polymer designed to resist lasers was the only mass the Avgi were willing to allocate to armor, and as such the Equinox is easily shot down by most modern antimissile systems."

	description "Developed concurrently with the Photikon Torpedo Bomber, the Equinox Torpedo is a large, minimally guided thermonuclear torpedo that allows even small drones to pose a credible threat to a capital warship."
	description "Unlike the nuclear missiles employed by the Avgi, the Equinox carries only enough propellant to make small adjustments to its trajectory, and lacks the ability to accelerate entirely. It instead relies on the speed of the bomber carrying it, trading an independent propulsive capability for an oversized warhead."
	description "This pylon externally mounts a single torpedo, employing a small electromagnetic catapult to fling the torpedo towards its target."

	description "This remotely operated reloading bay, intended for use on carriers, can quickly replenish a docked fighter or drone with Equinox Torpedoes. A generous stockpile of torpedoes allows a carrier to support multiple sorties before needing to resupply."
	description "The restocking system requires oversight by a small team of specialists to ensure no accidents occur during the loading process."
